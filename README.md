# VFX_Portfolio_Kiselev.A
My VFX Artist portfolio (Kiselev Alexey) @heinhex

The portfolio contains effects that are not covered by the NDA. Effects are optimized for Mobile.

I work in various styles, I can completely copy VFX based on the provided reference.

I optimize effects for mobile platforms and develop them according to the specified criteria.

I develop and configure effects both for ready-made mechanics and simulating mechanics to demonstrate the effect.

I write shaders for 90% of your tasks, and study the rest in the process. I work with Graph and Amplifier Shader systems (it's not a problem to study others).

I know about the problems of UI visualization in Unity, I will not take the layout on myself, but I will make your UX ideas a real dance with the user, leaving him in a state of Flow.

Good skills in working with visual accompaniment in the scene, effects of environment details, particle scattering, illumination of areas, image mobility. I will emphasize the project's strengths and draw attention away from its weaknesses.

I own a graphic editor at the level necessary for creating and processing particle textures.
Ready to bring to life the effects drawn by your CG illustrators.
!!! I don't draw illustrations, it's not interesting !!!

Extensive knowledge of the Unity engine and related graphics components. Working with various render pipelines and post processing.

I optimize the effects using the project Profiler, so I can upload and deploy the project without distracting the team. You have all the necessary skills to work with the project infrastructure from the technical to the managerial part.

My path runs through 10 years of experience in game design and project management, I will tell you where what rake, I will give good advice but I will not climb into someone else's work.

I love what I do! I live a project, if there is a problem, I solve it, if I don't know how to solve it, I study! I have no prejudices about "not my tasks" I take on any business that requires attention, I am focused on the result!
the
Overall portfolio is much more extensive, I am ready to prove it in the test task provided by you.
